# NeuroBytes Interneuron
The Interneuron is an open-source hardware neuron simulator designed and sold by NeuroTinker, LLC. Each device includes a number of inputs (dendrites) and outputs (the axon terminal) that can be freely connected to other NeuroBytes boards using 4-pin 'neurotransmitter' cables. Interneurons use a single RGB LED to indicate current status, and include a side-mounted push button for network identification. 
All NeuroBytes products are based on the ST32L0x series of ARM Cortex-M0+ 32-bit microcontrollers. The boards were designed in KiCad and Inkscape and are released under the terms of the GPL, v3.0.
This repository is a continuation of the 8-bit ATtiny design called [NeuroBytes v0.91](github/zakqwy/neurobytes). The two series are not compatible.

## Project Status
This project is in alpha. The firmware is in progress and the API may change at any time. The PCB design is physically tested but has not yet been manufactured at scale.
